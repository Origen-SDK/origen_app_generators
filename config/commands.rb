# This file should be used to extend the origen command line tool with tasks 
# specific to your application.
# The comments below should help to get started and you can also refer to
# lib/origen/commands.rb in your Origen core workspace for more examples and 
# inspiration.
#
# Also see the official docs on adding commands:
#   http://origen.freescale.net/origen/latest/guides/custom/commands/

# Map any command aliases here, for example to allow origen -x to refer to a 
# command called execute you would add a reference as shown below: 
aliases ={
#  "-x" => "execute",
}

# The requested command is passed in here as @command, this checks it against
# the above alias table and should not be removed.
@command = aliases[@command] || @command

## Now branch to the specific task code
#case @command
#
## Run the unit tests  
#when "specs"
#  ARGV.unshift "spec"
#  require "rspec"
#  # For some unidentified reason Rspec does not autorun on this version
#  if RSpec::Core::Version::STRING && RSpec::Core::Version::STRING == "2.11.1"
#    RSpec::Core::Runner.run ARGV
#  else
#    require "rspec/autorun"
#  end
#  exit 0 # This will never be hit on a fail, RSpec will automatically exit 1
#
## Run the example-based (diff) tests
#when "examples"  
#  Origen.load_application
#  status = 0
#
#  # Compiler tests
#  ARGV = %w(templates/example.txt.erb -t debug -r approved)
#  load "origen/commands/compile.rb"
#  # Pattern generator tests
#  #ARGV = %w(some_pattern -t debug -r approved)
#  #load "#{Origen.top}/lib/origen/commands/generate.rb"
#
#  if Origen.app.stats.changed_files == 0 &&
#     Origen.app.stats.new_files == 0 &&
#     Origen.app.stats.changed_patterns == 0 &&
#     Origen.app.stats.new_patterns == 0
#
#    Origen.app.stats.report_pass
#  else
#    Origen.app.stats.report_fail
#    status = 1
#  end
#  puts
#  exit status  # Exit with a 1 on the event of a failure per std unix result codes
#
## Always leave an else clause to allow control to fall back through to the
## Origen command handler.
## You probably want to also add the command details to the help shown via
## origen -h, you can do this be assigning the required text to @application_commands
## before handing control back to Origen. Un-comment the example below to get started.
#else
#  @application_commands = <<-EOT
# specs        Run the specs (tests), -c will enable coverage
# examples     Run the examples (tests), -c will enable coverage
#  EOT
#
#  # Uncomment the following and update the path with the file
#  # that handles the commands that are shared from this plugin
#  #require "#{Origen.app_root}/config/shared_commands"
#
#end
